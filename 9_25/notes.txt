Primary goal:
Make index.html and login.html so they core of it is the same that I have provided.
By "core" I mean the forms have the same inputs, with the same names.

Secondary goal:
Make it look pretty

Note:
CSS Stylesheets are really good practice. By all means talk about them, but please
refrain from using them for this mini project. Working with statics in Django
is a teensy bit complicated and we don't have time to get it working.
