---Things Covered---
-How the internet works
-What does Django do?

---Starting Django Project---

1. Start project ($ django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME)
2. Make sure that everyone can get on their hosted server
	$ python manage.py runserver
	in browser: localhost:8000
3. Create App (python manage.py startapp APPNAME)
	Add app to to installed apps in settings
	Note: To see what the name of the config function is, look in APPNAME/apps.py
4. How does Django know what HTML to send back?
	Explain views / how urls are processed in Django
5. Create views
	def index(request):
	def submit_login(request):
	def submit_logout(request)
	IMPORTANT: don't name view "login" or "logout", function name will clash with a Django function name
6. Setup URL files
	1. Create urls.py in app
	2. Route '/' to APPNAME/urls.py
		"url(r'^', include('MyApp.urls'))"
		IMPORTANT: must import include from django.conf.urls
	3. In APPNAME/urls.py route each url to its proper view
		url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
		url(r'^login/$', views.submit_login, name='login'),
		url(r'^logout/$', views.submit_logout, name='logout'),
7. Create templates folder in app, then create folder APPNAME in that
	This is so that Django doesn't get confused when it sees multiple index.HTML
	It is not necessary in this case but it is good to explain how Django finds templates
8. Copy HTML from wherever it is on the computer to this new folder
9. In index and submit_login view:
	return render(request, 'MyApp/index.html', {}})
	return render(request, 'MyApp/login.html', {}})
	IMPORTANT: from django.shortcuts import render
	Note: We are using render instead of httpresponse because then we don't have to switch it later.
