This is a lot to get through. It will be rough.

1. Start with submit_log. Have if statements for
	-if request.method == "GET":
	-elif request.method == "POST":
2. The POST will have data in the request. Get the username and password.

	There will be a csrf error. Must add: {% csrf_token %} to form.
3. Login the user
	1. Imports:
		from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login, logout
		from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	2.
