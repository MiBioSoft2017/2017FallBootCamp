---Things Covered---
-What is a relational database (Keep it short)
-How does Django use it

1. Create "Message" model
	class Message(models.Model):
		message = models.TextField()
		sender = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name="user_sender")
		recipient = models.ForeignKey(User,  related_name="user_recipient")
	IMPORTANT: from django.contrib.auth.models import User
			   related_name is necessary since we have two ForeignKey to the same table
2. Migrate (we need to migrate because the structure of the database is being altered)
	$python manage.py makemigrations
	$python manage.py migrate
3. Talk about how Django already has a model User. We just used it.
   Also talk about how Django provides a system for developers to manage data manually.
4. Fire up the server and take a look /admin
5. Create a super user in order to login
	$python manage.py createsuperuser
	Note: Only username and password are needed, others can be left blank
6. Go back to admin and log in. Notice that we can see users, but not messages.
   Create a new user. Later this is how they will test their website.
7. Go to APPNAME/admin.py and register model
	from django.contrib import admin
	from . import models
	# Register your models here.
	admin.site.register(models.Message)
8. Go back to admin and notice that you can see messages.
9. Deal with questions people have.
